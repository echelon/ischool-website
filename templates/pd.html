    <h2>Our PD is Different</h2>
    <p>Over many years, iSchool Initiative has worked with thousands of educators to bring you some of the most intuitive Professional Learning available. Technology has changed the game for us and we pride ourselve in sharing our way of thinking. Our focus is on...</p>

    <p>(TODO: These are icons!)</p>
    <p>Personalized - Learning in its purest form should be focused on the individual inside of a flexible learning environment with multiple content delivery mediums for students and teachers alike.</p>

    <p>Collaborative - Two or more learners capitalizing on one another's ideas, skills and resources towards a common goal or problem can greatly enhance the learning process for all parties involved...including us.</p>

    <p>Digital - As mobile initiatives continue to be the focus of many district’s plannings, the importance of providing quick and easy, digital content is growing.  Our library of content is constantly expanding for the benefit of our customers.</p>

    <h2>Keynotes</h2>
    <h3>The New Reality</h3>
    <p>On the horizon is a world that we could never have imagined thirty years ago. We are quickly progressing toward a society where human capital, or the creative ingenuity unique to human beings, is our greatest asset. Beginning with words of some of the great thinkers of our time, we ask, &ldquo;What implications does this have for education? Where will a teacher fit in?&rdquo; We discuss the amazing opportunities and foreboding pitfalls of a digital future, eventually leading to one stark conclusion: technology won’t save us without teachers and modern teaching methods.</p>
    <h3>Mobile in Rural Areas</h3>
    <p>This keynote details the use of technology in rural education with a focus on tablet devices. We discuss how mobile is used both in and out of the classroom setting for the betterment of scholastic and personal endeavors. The keynote will also look into how schools are using these technologies and will reference evidence for the utility of mobile tech in rural America. The widespread use and implementation of these technologies is important for the future of our education system and integral to leveling the playing field.</p>
    <h3>Awakening Your Creative Genius</h3>
    <p>Awakening Your Creative genius does exactly what the title suggests. It causes people to become aware of their own creative potential and understand how to harness it in education. This keynote takes creativity out of the confines of just art and music. Keep an open mind as this experience is not meant to teach the audience anything new, but rather to get people to see what they already know from a different perspective - causing a paradigm shift.</p>

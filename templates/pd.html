  <h2>Keynotes</h2>

  <h3>The New Reality</h3>
  <p>On the horizon is a world that we could never have imagined thirty years ago. We are quickly progressing toward a society where human capital, or the creative ingenuity unique to human beings, is our greatest asset. Beginning with words of some of the great thinkers of our time, we ask, &ldquo;What implications does this have for education? Where will a teacher fit in?&rdquo; We discuss the amazing opportunities and foreboding pitfalls of a digital future, eventually leading to one stark conclusion: technology won’t save us without teachers and modern teaching methods.</p>

  <h3>Mobile in Rural Areas</h3>
  <p>This keynote details the use of technology in rural education with a focus on tablet devices. We discuss how mobile is used both in and out of the classroom setting for the betterment of scholastic and personal endeavors. The keynote will also look into how schools are using these technologies and will reference evidence for the utility of mobile tech in rural America. The widespread use and implementation of these technologies is important for the future of our education system and integral to leveling the playing field.</p>

  <h3>Awakening Your Creative Genius</h3>
  <p>Awakening Your Creative genius does exactly what the title suggests. It causes people to become aware of their own creative potential and understand how to harness it in education. This keynote takes creativity out of the confines of just art and music. Keep an open mind as this experience is not meant to teach the audience anything new, but rather to get people to see what they already know from a different perspective - causing a paradigm shift.</p>

  <h2>Workshops</h2>

  <h3>Taking Notes</h3>
  <p>Some things have been done the same way for far too long. This workshop will demonstrate some of the best solutions for taking class notes on the iPad. By using a variety of applications, students can record class content in a way that best suits their comprehension and ability to recall. We focus on visual, auditory and kinesthetic learning styles and how each student can best employ their strengths in these areas.</p>

  <h3>Mobile Device Bootcamp</h3>
  <p>This is a great introduction to the revolutionary new tablet device that is sweeping schools as we speak. The iPad is designed to be a simple piece of technology with a minimal learning curve, though this does not mean there aren't things to be learned. Our workshop will cover such items as organizing your home screen, downloading and managing applications, working with text, troubleshooting connection problems, classroom display options, and many more. iPad Bootcamp is perfect for anyone who has just gotten their iPad and wants to know more about it, or is lost among the many capabilities it offers. We will get you up to speed!</p>

  <h3>Sound Factory</h3>
  <p>Students today connect to others through music, but how do you help a student transition from being a lover of music to creating their own masterpieces? Music teachers all over the US are integrating digital devices into their classrooms. Learn how music based apps are keeping students engaged and eager to connect with the world around them.</p>

  <h3>Learning in Motion</h3>
  <p>The field of Physical Fitness and Nutrition is rapidly changing. With obesity rates at their highest, this workshop shatters the impression that technology is nothing but a detriment to childrens' health. Workout training, nutrition advice, and other health information is moving into the 21st Century. We demonstrate how Physical Educators can use visually appealing and content rich applications to reconnect with their digital native students.</p>

  <h3>Science and Math with SWAG</h3>
  <p>This workshop is designed to get you familiar and proficient with math and science applications along with their classroom uses in order to maximize your classroom efficiency and teaching style. We will be discussing various subjects in science and mathematics and their application in the digital realm. Topics include chemistry, biology, physics, astronomy, and anatomy. Moving to mathematics, we discuss the beginnings of a major overhaul to instruction. When the workshop is over you will have a better understanding of how this technology applies not only to your life but most importantly your classroom.</p>

  <h3>Digital Storytelling</h3>
  <p>One of the best ways to teach is to tell a story. This workshop develops skilled digital storytellers who can captivate any audience by evoking strengths in different learning styles. It not only covers technical skills but also stresses the bigger picture of creative teaching styles in the classroom. Individuals who attend this workshop will learn how to best leverage new, exciting ways of weaving a story into a lesson.</p>

  <h3>Painting the Skies</h3>
  <p>An artist's world is limitless and always changing. As the digital age is upon us, it is no surprise that new methods of creating art are springing up shoots. Whether you are interested in sculpting, painting, design, or music, this session provides a peek into the world of the Digital Artist. These applications explore the use of apps to create magnificent and unique works of digital art as well as implementing apps as research tools that can assits you in the studio. As artists and lovers of art, the time has come for us to create and imagine with digital media as our canvas.</p>

  <h3>Reading on the iPad</h3>
  <p>Nothing has revolutionized reading more than the presence of tablets and smart phones. This workshop dives into the fundamentals of reading and phonics while focusing on the fun and engaging tools available on such devices. You will learn the basics for reading on an iPad as well as various applications that allow you to customize the curriculum and challenge each student.</p>

  <h3>Time Management &amp; Organization</h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Time isn't free, it’s priceless. You can’t own it, but you can use it. You can’t keep it, but you can spend it. Once you’ve lost it you can never get it back.&rdquo; -Harvey Mackay. Research shows that an average employee wasted 3 hours out of an 8 hour work day. This workshop is focused on bringing the power of time back into your hands. You will learn how to use mobile technology to better manage your time and get more organized.</p>

  <h2>Web Workshops</h2>

  <h3>Rediscovering the Art of Presentation with Prezi</h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Rediscovering the Art of Presentation with Prezi&rdquo; will teach you how to create an engaging presentation with today's web tools. Prezi is a free software for educators and students that allows building presentations that are not just linear. In this workshop you will not only learn how to use Prezi, but more importantly, you will also better understand how to be an effective communicator on stage.</p>

  <h3>Social Media in the Classroom</h3>
  <p>Geared for those who want to learn more, this workshop presents an exciting and involving introduction to the wide world of social media. Broken into segments, we first examine social media's role in our society and the ways in which students are using it in their daily lives. Attendees will get started on Twitter and demo a social-based Learning Management System. We then progress to a hands-on session where attendees learn to apply these social tools in the educational environment.</p>

  <h3>Google Apps</h3>
  <p>The Google Apps suite is a comprehensive package of services that can revolutionize the way a classroom is run. This workshop walks participants through Docs, Calendar, Contacts, News, YouTube/Khan Academy and Google+, and shows how they can keep students on a continuous feed of information from the instructor and each other. Adopting this set of simple web services is an excellent first step to modernizing your classroom. The best part is, it’s all completely free.</p>

  <h2>Panels and Discussions</h2>

  <h3>Challenges of a Digital Classroom</h3>
  <p>You look up from your screen only to feel a sudden throbbing in your temples. You stumble and spots form in front of your eyes as you try to pry yourself out from the chair. No one is a stranger to the drawbacks of too much time in front of the computer, but unfortunately, it’s only the beginning. In a world where mobile devices have become our constant companions, how can we balance their benefits with their disruptive potential? Are we entering an age of &ldquo;thintelligence&rdquo;; where individuals possess a great deal of thin surface knowledge about topics, but little depth? How do we manage a free and open internet while keeping students' eyes away from offensive content? Is the ability to access any fact at the touch of a button going to render testing obsolete? What about the 800 lb gorilla in the room: constant distractions like Facebook and text messages? This panel seeks to bring the words of both students and teachers together to discuss the challenges of a digital classroom and attempts to find real world solutions to them. These advances in technology are not going to stop coming, so can we adopt our mindset to keep up?</p>

  <h3>Cyber Bullying and Social Responsibilities</h3>
  <p>Living in the Digital Age, we are all connected in one way or another by the internet. In this bold new world, how do we maintain citizenship and interact with each other in a respecful manner? How is social media affecting our perception of reality? How do we navigate the myriad of avenues which are opened before us, all the while keeping a watchful eye on our moral compass? This panel will cover what it means to be a responsible citizen of our cyberspace, the causes and effects of cyberbullying, and how we can end the abuse.</p>

  <h3>Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants</h3>
  <p>Students today seem to have a much better grasp of the &ldquo;digital language&rdquo; of computers and mobile devices. As we are ushered into an era in which digital media surrounds us, there are those who seem to adopt technological breakthroughs with ease and those who find them to be a chore. The chasm that separates these two groups is typically caused by the notion that those born into the Information Age are better equipped to accept these changes. Yet, is it possible to remain the same in an environment that incessantly beckons for change? Is it easy for teachers to learn this &ldquo;digital language&rdquo; of new devices, or is this ability restricted to young minds? What is the best attitude approach? Can today's classroom model make accommodations for new technology or is the current structure the best method? Why do some find the idea of learning how to use digital devices threatening? Does staying knowledgeable about new technology need to be time consuming? How can students and teachers work together to close the gap between &ldquo;digital natives&rdquo; and &ldquo;digital immigrants&rdquo;?</p>

  <h3>Going Paperless</h3>
  <p>It was promised decades ago that technology and computers would make us a paperless society but in reality we have more paper waste than ever before. As college students, we take our tablet and only our tablet to all of our classes. We do not own paper, pens, books, or printers. In this panel, learn how you can go digital and become completely paperless. Come prepared to ask the panel questions on the struggles you have had going paperless.</p>

    <h2>Leading the Digital Learning Revolution</h2>
    <p>For the second year in a row, iSchool Initiative's grassroots movement to reform education takes to the road. The culmination of what we preach as mobile learners, the DLR Tour gives us the ability to extend our reach and affect the lives of students across the country. iSchool Initiative is traveling to schools, conferences and communities to bring excitement around the idea of mobile learning, and showcase their vision of a what a 21st century classroom can be.

    <p>For 2013, we are excited to announce the introduction of the Mobile Classroom Experience: A 38-foot bus outfitted with a complete mobile solution for schools. As we get educators excited with keynote presentations and workshops, this classroom-on-wheels demonstrates exactly how it can be done. We have brought together the services of nine different companies in the mobile space with the purpose of letting people experience a future classroom. Inside, you&lsquo;ll see how iSchool Initiative&lsquo;s passion is unifying an entire industry to make change a reality.</p>

          <p>Otterbox is a purveyor of high quality, durable cases for mobile devices. We first encountered Otterbox on our 2012 DLR Tour. Stopping by their headquarters in beautiful Fort Collins, Colorado, we uncovered a company that is about far more than manufacturing cases. In truth, Otterbox cares deeply about empowering youth and giving back to the community that fostered its growth. Working with Nancy Richardson (wife of founder Kurt Richardson) and her team at Ottercares, iSchool Initiative has begun a partnership to protect the mobile device investments schools are making across the country.</p>

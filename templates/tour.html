          <p>With its roots in education, Promethean has been empowering teachers for over 15 years. This past March, we joined forces with CEO Jim Marshall, SVP of Marketing Lupita Knittel, and other leaders to create an ambitious partnership. Promethean strongly believes that learning never ends. It was this love of lifelong learning, alongside their work to create connected learning systems with mobile devices and other classroom technology, that convinced us we have found a great match. We are grateful to have the experience, and dedicated support of Promethean throughout the 2013 DLR Tour.</p>

          <p>Otterbox is a purveyor of high-quality, durable cases for mobile devices. iSchool Initiative first collaborated with Otterbox during its 2012 DLR Tour. Stopping by the Otterbox headquarters in beautiful Fort Collins, Colorado, our team discovered a company that is truly dedicated to empowering youth and giving back to the community that fostered its growth. Working with Nancy Richardson (wife of founder Kurt Richardson) and her team at OtterCares, iSchool Initiative began a partnership tasked with protecting the mobile device investments schools are making across the country.</p>
